ABSTRACT
This dissertation examined the impact of positive framing (intervention 1), greenwashing awareness information (intervention 2) and general product utility information (control condition) on measures of green consumerism, including environmental concern, attitude towards green products, self-reported green purchase behaviour, perceived environmental knowledge and scepticism towards green advertisements in relations to bamboo products. An online experiment was conducted to test the effects these two interventions and control condition. Furthermore, this dissertation also tested the moderating influence of the interventions on relationship between the measures of green consumerism and scepticism towards green advertisements. The findings showed that greenwashing awareness considerably impacted the consumers purchase behaviour, attitude and scepticism. However, the two interventions failed to have a significant effect on perceived environmental knowledge and concern. Contrary to what was expected, there was no significant moderating impacts present. One of the key limitations of this dissertation is that some of the variables were self-reported measures like the purchase behaviour and the future studies can make use of real time purchase data. The outcomes of this dissertation can be applied by the marketers to carefully frame the advertisement content since additional information does not necessarily make a difference in consumer behaviour.
